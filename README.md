# 🦀 Rust Learning Journey: Beginner-to-Expert Roadmap

Welcome to **Rust Journey Labs** — a curated, hands-on roadmap to mastering Rust from the ground up. This repository is structured as a series of practical labs, each with its own guide and code, to help you learn Rust step by step.

Rust is a modern, systems-level programming language that emphasizes **performance**, **reliability**, and **memory safety**. It's trusted by tech giants like Microsoft, Dropbox, Cloudflare, and Amazon, and is used for everything from command-line tools to web services and embedded systems.

## 🚀 Why Learn Rust?

Rust is designed for developers who want to build high-performance, reliable, and safe software. Whether you're a systems programmer, web backend engineer, or just curious about modern languages, Rust has something to offer.

- **Performance:** Control over low-level details without sacrificing ergonomics.
- **Reliability:** Prevents entire classes of bugs at compile time.
- **Productivity:** Helpful error messages, a powerful package manager (Cargo), and a welcoming community.

## 🧭 Roadmap Overview

1. **Fundamentals:** Syntax, variables, data types, ownership, borrowing
2. **Practice:** CLI apps, exercises
3. **Intermediate:** Modules, traits, error handling, collections, lifetimes, generics
4. **Concurrency & Async:** Threads, async programming
5. **Web Development:** REST APIs, web servers
6. **Advanced:** Macros, unsafe code, systems programming
7. **Projects:** Real-world apps, open source contributions

# 🦀 Rust Journey Labs

Welcome to **Rust Journey Labs**, a curated collection of Rust code experiments, projects, and exercises that chart my journey from beginner to advanced Rustacean 🚀.

## 📚 Structure
```

* `/basics` → Syntax, ownership, data types
* `/cli-tools` → Command-line apps with `clap` and `structopt`
* `/web-dev` → REST APIs with `actix-web`, `rocket`, or `axum`
* `/async` → Async code using `tokio`, `futures`
* `/systems` → Memory management, unsafe code, performance hacks
* `/wasm` → WebAssembly projects for the browser
* `/projects` → Real-world apps, utilities, and OSS tools

```markdown

## 🚧 In Progress
I'm actively working on:
- 🔧 Mini CLI utilities
- 🌐 Building a microservice with `axum`
- 📦 Publishing a crate on crates.io

🚀 **Kicking off my Rust Programming Journey!** 🦀

I'm excited to dive deep into one of the most powerful, safe, and high-performance languages of our time — **Rust**! 🔧 Whether it's for CLI tools, blazing-fast web servers, or WebAssembly, Rust has so much potential to offer.

📁 I’ve launched a public GitHub repository where I’ll share all my learnings, mini-projects, and real-world experiments in Rust:
👉 `github.com/yourusername/rust-journey-labs`

🎯 From ownership & borrowing to async & systems programming, my goal is to explore Rust inside out.

💬 Rustaceans, I’d love to hear your learning tips, must-read resources, and open-source projects worth contributing to!
