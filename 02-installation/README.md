# üöÄ How to Install Rust: Beginner's Step-by-Step Guide

## Why Install Rust?

Before you can start coding in Rust, you need to set up your development environment. This guide will show you how to install Rust on Windows, Mac, and Linux‚Äîno experience required!

---

## Step 1: Download and Install Rust (with rustup)

Rust uses a tool called **rustup** to manage everything for you. It‚Äôs like an app store for Rust tools!

### Windows
- Go to [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and click the big button to download the installer.
- Run the installer and follow the prompts. (If it asks about Visual Studio, say yes‚Äîit helps Rust build programs on Windows.)

### Mac or Linux
- Open your Terminal app.
- Copy and paste this command, then press Enter:

  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
  ```
- Follow the on-screen instructions.

*Tip:* Installing Rust is like setting up your kitchen before you start cooking. You only need to do it once!

## Step 2: Verify Your Rust Installation

Open your terminal (or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows) and type:

```sh
rustc --version
```

If you see something like `rustc 1.XX.X (date)`, you‚Äôre ready to go!

## Step 3: Your Rust Toolbox

- **rustc**: The Rust compiler (turns your code into programs)
- **cargo**: The project manager (helps you build, run, and share Rust projects)
- **rustup**: The tool installer/updater

You get all of these automatically!

## Step 4: Next Steps After Installing Rust

- Try running `rustup doc` to open Rust‚Äôs local documentation in your browser.
- Choose a code editor you like (VS Code, Sublime, etc.). Most editors have Rust plugins for helpful features.
- If you run into trouble, check your system‚Äôs PATH or visit the [Rust community](https://www.rust-lang.org/community) for help.

## Troubleshooting Rust Installation

- If `rustc --version` doesn‚Äôt work, restart your terminal or computer.
- Make sure Rust is in your PATH (search online for ‚Äúadd to PATH‚Äù if unsure).
- Still stuck? The [official guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) has more tips.
